# Conclusion

## Summary

Pytracks was a tool which took a lot of learning to create. It took a lot of research to be able to create a tool which was both easy to use, and thus simple, but also intricate and expandable. The project requirements specified in the methods of this paper were achieved. It allowed the users to write code which visualizes data which is much shorter and easier to read and interpret than without it.

The major limit of pytracks is it's scope of usability is quite small in the grand scheme of things. The problem is that for something to be effective at what it does, it has to be specific and tailored to solving one problem. Pytracks has the potential to solve many other problems, but that takes extra effort by another developer to implement solutions for that.

In the end, I feel pytracks was effective in solving the problem at hand. It was able to allow developers to create visualizations much easier than if they were just trying to use the file without this library. The ultimate goal of pytracks was to let it do the work of wrapping these raw data files, just leaving the visualization work left to the user, saving him or her time and energy.

## Future Work

This project can be expanded in multiple ways:
1. More built in flexibility for the raw data input files.
2. More built in methods for proccessing the data.
3. More examples could be written to show its uses.
4. Could be expanded to actually visualize the data and not just wrap it.
