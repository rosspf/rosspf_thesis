abstract = {The northwestern Gulf of Mexico currently experiences a large hypoxic area (“dead zone”) during the summer. While the local effects of hypoxia on organisms have been documented, the population-level effects are largely unknown. I developed a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to analyze how hypoxia effects on Atlantic croaker reproduction, growth, and mortality in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico could lead to population-level responses. The model follows the hourly growth, mortality, reproduction, and movement of individuals on a 300 x 800 spatial grid of 1 km2 cells for 100 years. Chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were specified daily for each grid cell for an average year, which was repeated every year. A bioenergetics model was used to represent growth, mortality was assumed age- and size-dependent, and the movement behavior of juveniles and adults was modeled as an unconditioned response to external cues (kinesis) coupled with a neighborhood search algorithm that emulated hypoxia avoidance. Hypoxia effects were imposed using vitality-repair submodels that convert time-varying exposures to reduced hourly growth, increased hourly mortality, and reduced annual fecundity. Results showed that 80 years of either mild or intermediate hypoxia produced small reductions in population abundance, while severe hypoxia caused a 31{\%} reduction in long-term population abundance. The response to severe hypoxia was added age-1 and age-2 daily mortality (8-9{\%}) and a 5{\%} average reduction in eggs per individual. Relatively few individuals (5{\%}) were exposed each hour but many individuals (20-40{\%}) experienced at least one hour of low DO each year. The effects slowly built up in the model over years; population abundance slowly declined for 40 years before the 31{\%} reduction was realized. Under more realistic hypoxia conditions of mild, intermediate, and severe hypoxia years occurring in proportion to their historical frequency, the model predicted an 18-29{\%} decrease in the long-term population abundance. Sensitivity analysis showed hypoxia effects via reduced growth were small, and aspects of avoidance behavior were important in determining the population response. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling, and future plans for refining the analysis based on data from ongoing field and laboratory studies.},

abstract = {The distribution and interactions of aquatic organisms across space and time structure our marine, freshwater, and estuarine ecosystems. Over the past decade, technological advances in telemetry have transformed our ability to observe aquatic animal behavior and movement. These advances are now providing unprecedented ecological insights by connecting animal movements with measures of their physiology and environment. These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems. The next advance in aquatic telemetry will be the development of a global collaborative effort to facilitate infrastructure and data sharing and management over scales not previously possible.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been suggested as a tool that can achieve some of the goals of an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), e.g. prevention of overexploitation, biodiversity conservation, recovery of overexploited population, but the conse- quences of their establishment on the dynamics of protected components are often unclear. Spatial and multispecies models can be used to investigate the effects of their introduction. An individual-based, spatially explicit, size-structured, multispecies model (known as OSMOSE) is used to investigate the likely consequences of the introduction of three MPAs off the coast of South Africa, individually or in combination. The simultaneous introduction of the MPAs affected varying proportions of the distribution of the modelled species (5–17{\%}) and 12{\%} of the distribution of the whole community. In general, the introduction of the MPAs in the different scenarios resulted in a relative increase in the biomass of large predatory fish and a decrease in the biomass of small pelagic fish. The simulation demonstrates that consideration of trophic interactions is necessary when introducing MPAs, with indirect effects that may be detrimental to some (mainly smaller prey) species.},
