# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who me helped out. -->

I would like to thank Dr. Karki and Dr. Kenneth Rose for allowing me to work on a project bridged between the Oceanography and Computer Science departments of LSU. Their guidance and patience with me allowed me to finish this project. I would also like to thank Dr. Anas "Nash" Mahmoud for his guidance and experience. He gave me many ideas on how to effectively visualize this data. All of the support of my committee allowed me to create a project I would of never been able to do on my own.

I would also like to thank my family and friends who has also supported and helped me throughout my studies. I would not be here if it wasn't for the love and support they provide.
