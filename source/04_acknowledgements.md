# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who me helped out. -->

I would like to thank Dr. Karki and Dr. Kenneth Rose for allowing me to work on a project bridged between the Oceanography and Computer Science departments of LSU. Their guidance and patience with me allowed me to finish this project. I would also like to thank Dr. Anas "Nash" Mahmoud for his guidance and experience on the software engineering side of this project. All of the support of my committee allowed me to create a project I would of never been able to do on my own.
